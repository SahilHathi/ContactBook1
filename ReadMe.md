CSC1034: Practical 2
====================
Portfolio 2
===========

In this practical we were told to create a contact book. Having no prior computer science knowledge this meant doing a lot of background reading. My code is most definitely not the neatest but I have made efforts in learning how to make it look more pleasing, or at least I tried. This code is meant to store user inputs that you type in order for you to search for certain contacts. This way you can easily find the people you want to and their details that the user has input.
